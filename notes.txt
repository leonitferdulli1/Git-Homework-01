1. Git is a version control that tracks our code and keeps check of what changes were made to it.
2. A repository (such as Github) stores our code for widespread easier access and collaborating with partners.
3. Branches let us work in isolation so we don't mess up the master branch.
4. Git commits are used to make a permanent record of our project, up until that point.
5. Pull requests need to be reviewed first before they are merged back with the master branch.
